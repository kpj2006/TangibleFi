# Loan Validation Fixes

## Problem
Transaction execution was reverting with error:
```
transaction execution reverted (action="sendTransaction", data=null, reason=null, invocation=null, revert=null, transaction={ ... }, receipt={ "status": 0 })
```

## Root Cause
The transaction was being sent to the contract without proper validation of all contract-side conditions, causing it to revert during execution.

## Solution
Implemented comprehensive pre-validation that matches the exact logic in `AutomationLoan.sol`:

### Enhanced Validation Checks

1. **Duration Validation**
   - Ensures loan duration is between 30-365 days
   - Validates payment periods calculation
   - Matches contract `MIN_LOAN_DURATION` and `MAX_LOAN_DURATION`

2. **NFT Ownership Validation**
   - Checks `ds.User[owner][tokenId].isAuth && ds.User[owner][tokenId].amount > 0`
   - Uses `getUserInvestments()` to verify actual ownership
   - Ensures user has authorized and funded investment

3. **Existing Loan Check**
   - Verifies no active loan exists for the tokenId
   - Checks `ds.loans[tokenId].isActive` equivalent
   - Uses `getUserLoans()` and `getLoanById()` for verification

4. **Token Address Validation**
   - Ensures token address is not zero address
   - Validates against contract requirements

5. **Allowance and Balance Validation**
   - Checks exact contract formula: `amount + bufferAmount + bufferAmount`
   - Verifies user has sufficient token balance
   - Validates allowance for the diamond contract

6. **Contract Balance Check**
   - Ensures lending pool has sufficient funds
   - Prevents failed transfers due to insufficient contract balance

7. **Final ViewFacet Validation**
   - Calls `validateLoanCreationView()` which mirrors contract validation
   - Catches any remaining validation issues

### User Experience Improvements

1. **Test Button**
   - Added "Test" button in debug mode on confirm step
   - Allows users to run validation before submitting transaction
   - Provides clear error messages for each validation failure

2. **Enhanced Error Messages**
   - Specific error messages for each validation failure
   - Shows exact amounts, balances, and requirements
   - Helps users understand what needs to be fixed

3. **Pre-transaction Validation**
   - All validation runs before transaction is submitted
   - Prevents gas waste from failed transactions
   - Provides immediate feedback to users

## Code Changes

### Main Changes in `loan-request-modal.tsx`:

1. **Enhanced `validateLoanCreation()` function**
   - 8-step comprehensive validation process
   - Matches exact contract logic
   - Detailed error reporting and debugging

2. **Test functionality**
   - Debug test button for pre-validation
   - Enhanced error handling with specific messages
   - Improved user feedback

3. **Transaction flow**
   - Validation runs first with user feedback
   - Only proceeds to transaction if validation passes
   - Better error handling for contract reverts

## Testing

To test the validation:

1. **Open loan modal in debug mode**
2. **Configure a loan with invalid parameters** (e.g., wrong token, insufficient allowance)
3. **Click "Test" button** - should show specific validation errors
4. **Fix issues and test again** - should pass validation
5. **Submit transaction** - should succeed without revert

## Expected Results

- ✅ No more transaction reverts due to validation issues
- ✅ Clear error messages before transaction submission
- ✅ Better user experience with immediate feedback
- ✅ Gas savings from prevented failed transactions
- ✅ Comprehensive debugging information for troubleshooting

## Next Steps

1. **Test with various edge cases**:
   - Assets without proper authorization
   - Insufficient token balances/allowances
   - Invalid loan durations
   - Assets with existing loans

2. **Monitor for any remaining edge cases**
3. **Consider adding allowance approval flow** if users need to approve tokens
4. **Add balance checking and warnings** for insufficient funds
